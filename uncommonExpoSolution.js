Solutions to this type of error vary depending on the root cause revealed in the build logs. However, here are some common approaches:

1. **Dependency Resolution:** If the error points to a specific dependency, try updating or removing that dependency.  If using native modules, make sure the Android build configuration in your `android/app/build.gradle` file is correct and up-to-date.

2. **Gradle Configuration:** Double-check the settings in your `android/app/build.gradle` file, paying close attention to sections like dependencies, build tools versions, and configurations. Ensure that the versions are compatible with each other.

3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Use the Expo CLI command `expo prebuild` to clean and rebuild the project. This can sometimes resolve transient issues caused by cached files.

4. **Android SDK and Build Tools:** Verify that you have the necessary Android SDK components, build tools, and NDK installed and up-to-date. Use the Android Studio SDK manager to update or install missing components.

5. **Community Support:** If none of these steps work, search online forums and communities (e.g., Stack Overflow, Expo forums) for similar error reports.  Providing detailed information from your build logs can significantly help others diagnose the problem.
