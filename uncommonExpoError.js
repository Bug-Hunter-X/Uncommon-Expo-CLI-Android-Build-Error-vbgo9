This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves an issue with the Android build process.  It's not a standard error message, so debugging requires examining the complete build logs for clues.  The error might stem from problems with native dependencies, incorrect configurations in your `android/app/build.gradle` file, or issues with the Android SDK or build tools.  The logs often point to a specific build step or file causing the failure.
